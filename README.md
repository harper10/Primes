Primes
======

This repository has a program that finds prime numbers.

I am basing this off of one of my homework assignments where we had to find whether a number was prime or not.  The program used threads to make the program faster.  I wanted to try a method where instead of dividing by every odd number less than squareroot, I want to divide by just the prime numbers less than the squareroot of the number.

I am adding a file that contains a list of prime numbers, and the file will add more primes to that file.
